## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

- In this project, I improved my understanding of Tailwind CSS for creating responsive and aesthetically pleasing form components. 
- I also gained experience in form validation.

### Continued development

- In future projects, I aim to enhance my skills in form handling, validation, and integrating JavaScript for more interactive and dynamic forms. 
- Additionally, I want to explore more advanced features of Tailwind CSS.

### Useful resources

- Tailwind CSS Documentation (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me understand how to use utility-first CSS classes effectively.
